# Module I: Saturday

* Shaders, to create filters that process your visuals in real time, much faster than using plain Processing code. 
* Mathematical tricks when using randomness to get more interesting aesthetics. 
* Creating 3D shapes with the heMesh and ToxicLibs libraries, which provide tons of new features to Processing. 
* How to create smooth animation with easing, to produce a more natural effect. How to create sequenced animations with specific durations.

## Project 

Produce a video clip for a song using 3D meshes, shader deformation and effects, and easing. The song will be analyzed using FFT.

## Easing and sequencing

* Unknown duration
  * Interpolate towards target (lerp)
* Known duration
  * Easing functions
  * Penner easing library
* Sequencer class

# Day project 

Produce a video clip for a song using 3D meshes, shader deformation and effects, and easing. The song will be analyzed using FFT.

# Easing and sequencing

* Unknown duration
  * Interpolate towards target (lerp)
* Known duration
  * Easing functions
  * Penner easing library
* Sequencer class

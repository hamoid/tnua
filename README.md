Code from the Collaborative Processing workshop at TNUA - Taipei National University of the Arts

These are Processing only examples and require the oscP5 library (http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/).

For basic Processing tutorials, see http://funprogramming.org

You could use oscP5 together with https://github.com/sebpiq/rhizome
It's a nodejs based server that can simplify interaction between OSC devices and browsers.
